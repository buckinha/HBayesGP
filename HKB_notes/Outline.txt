#Step 1
#create a dataset with replicates and variance estimates

#Step 2
#fit a gaussian process over the data using point variances

#Step 3
#use L-BFGS-B to climb down the lower confidence bound
# - multiple restarts, probably with grid or latin square?

#Step 4
#use the lowest discovered point on the lower confidence bound
# as the new sampling point.
# - if multiple low points are found for different decents, why
#   not sample on all of them?

#Step 5
#repeat from Step 2, adding the new samples to the set.
# - but Stop Eventually



#OPTIONALLY
# - Add the gaussian hyperparameters to the optimization routine
#   This would mean fitting multiple GP to the data, and, what?
#   Averaging?... Probably probability weighed sums?
# - Using "fantasies" to add more samples to the set to be simulated
